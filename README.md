# Handwritten Digit Prediction Project

This project uses a neural network to predict handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build and train a neural network model to accurately predict digits from images.

## Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Load and visualize the MNIST dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the images.
3. **Model Building**: Define and compile a neural network model.
4. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
6. **Prediction**: Make predictions and visualize some results.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```
2. Open the `Handwritten_Digit_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
